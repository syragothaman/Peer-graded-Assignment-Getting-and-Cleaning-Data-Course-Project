Project Purpose: Analyze the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set by tidying up the data.

Raw data: The full description of the data set can be found on UCI's website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.
Here is the actual data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Look at the README to see what the code in run_analysis.R should do based on the 5 steps provided by the project instructions.

After downloading the dataset from above, here is a general guide to the variables created:

1. Assigning raw data to variables: 
features <- features.txt (561 rows, 2 columns)
The accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ are the basis for the features.
activities <- activity_labels.txt (6 rows, 2 columns)
These are the activities performed with its corresponding codes (or labels) and measurements. 
subjecttest <- test/subject_test.txt (2947 rows, 1 column)
This is the test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
xtest <- test/X_test.txt (2947 rows, 561 columns)
This is the features test data recorded by UCI.
ytest <- test/y_test.txt (2947 rows, 1 column)
This is the test data of activities’ code labels
subjecttrain <- test/subject_train.txt (7352 rows, 1 column)
This is the train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
xtrain <- test/X_train.txt (7352 rows, 561 columns)
This is the features train data
ytrain <- test/y_train.txt (7352 rows, 1 column)
This is the train data of activities’ code labels

2. Merging variables:
Uses rbind(): 
x (10229 rows, 561 columns) merges xtrain and xtest
y (10299 rows, 1 column) merges ytrain and ytest
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) merges subjecttrain and subjecttest
Uses cbind():
data (10299, 563 columns) merges Subject, y, and x

3. Extract key measurements:
cleanned data (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by selecting means and standard deviations from the columns 
"subject" and "code" from the "data" variable

4. Assign descriptive names to activities:
Numbers in the code column of "cleaneddata" are replaced with the name of each corresponding activity
Then, each label is replaced with its corresponding full descriptive name:

code column in TidyData renamed into activities
Acc replaced by Accelerometer
Gyro  replaced by Gyroscope
Mag replaced by Magnitude
BodyBody replaced by Body
Mean, STD, and Frequency replace their respective abbreviations
TimeBody, Gravity, and Angle replace their respective abbrevations/capitalization errors
Anything starting with an f or t is respectively replaced by Frequency and Time.
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

5. Create a second independent set with variable means only:
indeptinydata (180 rows, 88 columns) summarizes cleaneddata by selecting only the means of each variable for each activity
Export indeptinydata into "Final_Data_set.txt"
