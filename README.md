# Peer-graded-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Course Project for a Coursera Module
By: Sowmya Ragothaman

This README is for the repository submitted for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course's Project. It explains how all of the scripts work.

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones is the dataset that is analyzed.

Files:

CodeBook.md describes the data and its corresponding variables through  transformations I coded to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R is the code. Using the following steps, I tidied up the data: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Final_Data_set.txt is the final data required for the course project. I saved it as a separate file after running the original code.
